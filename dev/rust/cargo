# NOTE: This is, at most, a crutch as it does not reference the same nixpkgs-unstable version as the current flake.lock.
#       Nevertheless, it can be used to run `cargo install-update -a` which is still needed in the transition phase.
#       Run `nix-channel --update` to update global channels.
